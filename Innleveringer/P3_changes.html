    <p>
        In order to make the testing document as close to a testing document one would use in a real project, the team
        decided to base the test questions on some of the questions used in a System Usability Scale document
        (henceforth shortened to SUS). The testers are then given a list of statements that they are asked to provide a
        number between 1 and 5 for. The number represents their agreement with the statement. That is, 1 means
        "strongly diasagree", whereas 5 means "strongly agree".
    </p>
    <p>
        We modified the original questions of the SUS document (see the
        <a href="#sources">Sources section</a>) to better suit our aims and purposes. In addition, we added a couple of
        questions of our own. The extra questions were added, primarily, because the team  was interested in how the
        testers evaluate their own technological competence. It would be of great interest to see if we reached our goal
        of having the web site being easy to use, even for people who don't see themselves as computer savvy. For the
        same reason, finding out how the web site was perceived by different age groups was of equal interest.
    </p>
    <p>The questions used were (in Norwegian):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hvor gammel er du?</li>
        <li>Jeg synes data og andre teknologier er lette å lære seg.</li>
        <li>Jeg føler jeg har god kontroll på data.</li>
        <li>Jeg tror jeg kunne likt å brukt denne nettsiden ofte.</li>
        <li>Jeg synes nettsiden var unødig kompleks.</li>
        <li>Jeg synes nettsiden var lett å bruke.</li>
        <li>Jeg synes det var lett å navigere meg rundt på nettsiden.</li>
        <li>Jeg tror de fleste ville synes at nettsiden er enkel å bruke.</li>
    </ol>
