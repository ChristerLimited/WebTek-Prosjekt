        As the project transpired, the team had to make some changes to the web site. The changes was made primarily by
        the members of the team, but some came from the client, as well. The rest of this section will compare each
        page with the original page design found in the P2 Design Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>startside.html:</b></i> This page is, in many ways, similar to the original design. One difference is that,
        instead of having five pictures, the page now has four pictures. The reasoning behind this decision was, seeing
        that we discarded the candles and napkins product section (see
        <a href="#produkter_lys_og_servietter">produkter_lys_og_servietter.html</a> below), we wanted the pictures to act
        as links to the product section. The product section now has four categories, hence the landing page has four
        pictures. Another change is that it is not possible to zoom in on the pictures on the landing page.  Zooming in
        on the pictures at the landing page was regarded by the members as something that should belong to the
        product sections, not the landing page. The final major change made to the landing page was moving the Instagram
        feed to kontakt_oss.html. In hindsight, the team felt that Instagram belonged as part of the contact us page.
        In any case, the footer contains a link to their Instagram page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>om_oss.html:</b></i> This page is for all intents and purposes identical to the original page design,
        except for the addition of the address of the business embedded in Google Maps. The team decided to move the
        Google Maps extension from Kontakt Oss to Om Oss in order to make Om Oss a bit more interesting. Also, the
        address of the business is at all times located in the footer. For this reason, the members of the team found
        the decision justified.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>kontakt.html:</b></i> Previously called "kontakt_oss.html", this page was shortened to "kontakt.html" by
        a misunderstanding by one of the team members. The page design differs from the original design in some respects.
        Firstly, as mentioned above, the page no longer has Google Maps. Also, as a consequence of Instagram feed
        integration being a cumbersome endeavor, the page now has a single Instagram photo instead. Analogously, we did
        the same for the Facebook feed. In this way, although it is not as flashy as Instagram or Facebook feeds, it nonetheless
        shows the user that the business has a social media presence. Highlighting the social media aspects of the
        business was one of the main purposes of the web site, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>tilbakemeldinger.html:</b></i> Previously called "henvendelser.html", this page was shortened to "kontakt.html" by
        a misunderstanding by one of the team members.
    </p>
    <p id="produkter_lys_og_servietter">
        <i><b>produkter_lys_og_servietter.html:</b></i> The client, initally having asked us to make a
        product section for candles and napkins, realized that she did not have any apt pictures for this purpose.
        Together with the client, the team decided to simply drop this section altogether.
