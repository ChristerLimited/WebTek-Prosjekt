        <h3>Changes to the Universal Design</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        In most respects, the universal design is the same as in the P2 Design Document. There are a couple of differences,
        however, and we will present them below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>The navigation bar:</b></i> Although it is similar in many respects, we have made some changes to the
        drop down effect when the user clicks on "Produkter" (see <a href="#drop_down_menu">navbar_script.js</a> below).
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>Footer:</b></i> There have been a couple of changes in the footer. First of all, the order of the various
        elements is now:  "Kontakt oss", "Åpningstider", Facebook icon and Instagram icon. Incidentally, the icons are
        not icons stored locally, but are obtained via a URL. In the "Åpningstider"
        element, we have added a JavaScript script that lets the user know whether the store is open or not at the time
        of browsing the page (see <a href="#get_time">getTime.js</a> below).
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>Font family and font size:</b></i> In the P2 Design Document, we specified that the web site would use
        two different fonts. More specifically, we specified that the content would have the font family "Raleway",
        wheras headers and the navigation bar would use "Playfair Display" (both from Google Fonts). We ended up only
        using "Raleway". The reason for this was a matter of convenience and that we liked the way it looked, even  in
        the navigation bar and in headers.
    </p>
    <header>
        <h3>Modfications of the HTML Documents</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        As the project transpired, the team had to make some changes to the web site. The changes were made primarily by
        the members of the team, but some came from the client, as well. The rest of this section will compare each
        page with the original page design found in the P2 Design Document.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>startside.html:</b></i> This page is, in many ways, similar to the original design. One difference is that,
        instead of having five pictures, the page now has four pictures. The reasoning behind this decision was, seeing
        that we discarded the candles and napkins product section (see
        <a href="#produkter_lys_og_servietter">produkter_lys_og_servietter.html</a> below), we wanted the pictures to act
        as links to the product section. The product section now has four categories, hence the landing page has four
        pictures. Another change is that it is not possible to zoom in on the pictures on the landing page.  Zooming in
        on the pictures at the landing page was regarded by the members as something that should belong to the
        product sections, not the landing page. The final major change made to the landing page was moving the Instagram
        feed to kontakt.html. In hindsight, the team felt that Instagram belonged as part of the "Kontakt oss" page.
        In any case, the footer contains a link to their Instagram page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>om_oss.html:</b></i> This page is for all intents and purposes identical to the original page design,
        except for the addition of the address of the business embedded in Google Maps. The team decided to move the
        Google Maps extension from "Kontakt oss" to "Om oss" in order to make "Om oss" a bit more interesting. Also, the
        address of the business is at all times located in the footer. For this reason, the members of the team found
        the decision justified.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>kontakt.html:</b></i> Previously called "kontakt_oss.html", this page was shortened to "kontakt.html" by
        a misunderstanding by the team members. The page design differs from the original design in some respects.
        Firstly, as mentioned above, the page no longer has Google Maps. Also, as a consequence of Instagram feed
        integration being a cumbersome endeavor, the page now has a single Instagram photo instead. Analogously, we did
        the same for the Facebook feed. In this way, although it is not as flashy as Instagram or Facebook feeds, it nonetheless
        shows the user that the business has a social media presence. Highlighting the social media aspects of the
        business was one of the main purposes of the web site, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>tilbakemeldinger.html:</b></i> Previously called "henvendelser.html", this page was shortened to "kontakt.html" due to a
        a misunderstanding by the team members. The design of the page is nearly identical to the original design. Some changes
        were made as to where the form fields and their corresponding labels are placed. Another modification is that the group
        has added a list of requirements that need to be filled out before sending the form.
        As the user fills out the various fields, the list of requirements will be updated dynamically (see the
        <a href="#empty_fields_check">checkForEmptyFields.js section.</a> for a more thorough description).
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>Pages of the form produkter_X.html:</b></i> These are more or less the same. The only diffrence is that
        border radius and hover effects have been added on the picture to make them more presentable.
    </p>
    <header>
        <h3>Removed Pages</h3>
    </header>
    <p id="produkter_lys_og_servietter">
        <i><b>produkter_lys_og_servietter.html:</b></i> The client, initially having asked us to make a
        product section for candles and napkins, realized that she did not have any apt pictures for this purpose.
        Together with the client, the team decided to simply drop this section altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>produkter.html:</b></i> The intention of this page was for it to act as a kind of "mini landing page" for
        the different product sections. However, during the development process, it became clear that the page would be
        redundant. Furthermore, it is just as easy, we would argue, to simply use the navigation bar. For these reasons, we
        removed this page from the web site.
    </p>

        <h2>Changes to the Minimum Requirements</h2>
    </header>
    <header>
        <h3>Final Minumum Requirements</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        During the project the team ended up changing some of the minimum requirements. This was done mostly because
        form validation and displaying text on hover could more easily be implementing HTML and CSS. Consequently, the
        team made provided two new JavaScript functionalities. The final minimum requirements was:
    </p>
    <p id="empty_fields_check">
        <i><b>checkForEmptyFields.js:</b></i> For each form field the user fill out, the script will dynamically update a
        list of required fields to be filled out. This list is displayed to the left of the form fields. When the user has filled
        out every form field, the list will contain only a single element telling the user that every field has been
        answered. This requirement was implemented by Vemund.
    </p>
    <p id="drop_down_menu">
        <i><b>navbar_script:</b></i> <i>In lieu</i> of a regular drop down menu, the drop downmenu now goes under the
        navigation bar. The drop down menu comes in from the left and displays the product categories. This requirement
        was implemented by Paul Erik.
    </p>
    <p id="get_time">
        <i><b>getTime.js:</b></i> This script checks the time at which the user is browsing the page. If the user is
        browsing at a time at which the store is open, it will update the "Åpningstider" element in the footer. The
        element will now say "Åpent". Analoguously, near closing time, "Åpningstider" will display "Stenger snart".
        Lastly, in the timespan at which the store is closed, "Åpningstider" will display "Stengt". This requirement was
        implemented by Peder.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>pictureZoom.js:</b></i> This requirement was implemented in accordance with the description in the P2
        Design Document. This requirement was implemented by Christer.
    </p>
    <header>
        <h3>Additional Scripts</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        We added an additional script for the Facebook icon and the Instagram icon in the footer:
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>linkSocial_inFooter.js:</b></i> This script makes the Facebook and the Instagram icon bigger on hover. It
        additionally sets the link of Steintøykjelleren's Facebook profile to the Facebook icon. Similarly, the link for
        Steintøykjelleren's Instagram profile is also set.
    </p>
</section>
<section>
    <header>
        <h3>Modularity</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
        Modularity was handled handled via CSS and JavaScript. For instance, the universal design was written
        in the CSS file "main.css", which was included in every HTML page. An example of JavaScript modularity is
        "pictureZoom.js". Every product section had pictures, so we used "pictureZoom.js" for each product section.
    </p>
    <p>
        The JavaScript modularity was implemented by those who had created the script (see the section above to see
        who made the various scripts). The universal design in CSS was made by everyone. However, Paul Erik did most of
        the implementation of the navigation bar CSS, Peder implemented much of the footer, and Christer made the
        common CSS for the product section.
