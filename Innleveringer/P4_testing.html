        <h2>Testing Document</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        In order to make the testing document as close to a testing document one would use in a real project, the team
        decided to base the test questions on some of the questions used in a System Usability Scale document
        (henceforth shortened to SUS). The testers are then given a list of statements that they are asked to provide a
        number between 1 and 5 for. The number represents their agreement with the statement. That is, 1 means
        "strongly diasagree", whereas 5 means "strongly agree".
    </p>
    <p>
        We modified the original questions of the SUS document (see the
        <a href="#sources">Sources section</a>) to better suit our aims and purposes. In addition, we added a couple of
        questions of our own. The extra questions were added, primarily, because the team  was interested in how the
        testers evaluate their own technological competence. It would be of great interest to see if we reached our goal
        of having the web site being easy to use, even for people who don't see themselves as computer savvy. For the
        same reason, finding out how the web site was perceived by different age groups was of equal interest.

        <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        When finding a tester audience, the team had a discussion regarding the most important features we wanted to
        test for -- trying to keep in mind the goals of the web site, namely making the page easy to navigate for people
        of all ages and levels of technological competence. The team members decided that they should try to make a tester
        audience that varied across ages and technological competence. We divided the tester audience into three age
        categories: young (15-30 years old), adult (30-60 years old), older (60+ years old). In addition, the tester
        audience was divided into two categories of technological competence: technologically competent (scoring 3 or more
        on questions 2 or 3 above) and technologically less competent (scoring 2 or lower on questions 2 or 3 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that our target audience is very diverse indeed -- men and women; young as well as old; more and less
        technologically competent --  finding a representative sample proved difficult. These difficulties,
        combined with a busy schedule and less than ideal planning on our part, resulted in us having a small sample.
        As a consequence of this, one should be extremely careful about drawing conclusions based on this.
        On the bright side, we managed to find a sample that had a large age difference. We also managed to find some
        variety in technological competence.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the percentages of each category of the tester audience (obtained from the
