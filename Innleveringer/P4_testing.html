        <h2>Testing Document</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        In order to make the testing document as close to a testing document one would use in a real project, the team
        decided to base the test questions on some of the questions used in a System Usability Scale document
        (henceforth shortened to SUS). The testers are then given a list of statements that they are asked to provide a
        number between 1 and 5 for. The number represents their agreement with the statement. That is, 1 means
        "strongly diasagree", whereas 5 means "strongly agree".
    </p>
    <p>
        We modified the original questions of the SUS document (see the
        <a href="#sources">Sources section</a>) to better suit our aims and purposes. In addition, we added a couple of
        questions of our own. The extra questions were added, primarily, because the team  was interested in how the
        testers evaluate their own technological competence. It would be of great interest to see if we reached our goal
        of having the web site being easy to use, even for people who don't see themselves as computer savvy. For the
        same reason, finding out how the web site was perceived by different age groups was of equal interest.
    </p>
    <p>Misforståelse med skala</p>
    <p>The questions used were (in Norwegian):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hvor gammel er du?</li>
        <li>Jeg synes data og andre teknologier er lette å lære seg.</li>
        <li>Jeg føler jeg har god kontroll på data.</li>

        <li>Jeg synes nettsiden var lett å bruke.</li>
        <li>Jeg synes det var lett å navigere meg rundt på nettsiden.</li>

        <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        When finding a tester audience, the team had a discussion regarding the most important features we wanted to
        test for -- trying to keep in mind the goals of the web site, namely making the page easy to navigate for people
        of all ages and levels of technological competence. The team members decided that they should try to make a tester
        audience that varied across ages and technological competence. We divided the tester audience into three age
        categories: young (15-30 years old), adult (30-60 years old), older (60+ years old). In addition, the tester
        audience was divided into two categories of technological competence: technologically competent (scoring 3 or more
        on questions 2 or 3 above) and technologically less competent (scoring 2 or lower on questions 2 or 3 above).
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that our target audience is very diverse indeed -- men and women; young as well as old; more and less
        technologically competent --  finding a representative sample proved difficult. These difficulties,
        combined with a busy schedule and less than ideal planning on our part, resulted in us having a small sample.
        As a consequence of this, one should be extremely careful about drawing conclusions based on this.
        On the bright side, we managed to find a sample that had a large age difference. We also managed to find some
        variety in technological competence.
    </p>
    <p>
        The client was also invited to test the page and provide feedback. She accepted the invitation, and we received
        some valuable feedback (see <a href="#feedback">the feedback section</a> below).
    </p>
    <p>Here are the percentages of each category of the tester audience (obtained from the results of the Google Form
        (see <a href="#feedback">the feedback section</a> below)):</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Percentage</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Young</td>
            <td>50%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Adult</td>
            <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Older</td>
            <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Technologically competent</td>
            <td>75 %</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Technologically less competent</td>
            <td>25 %</td>
        </tr>

        <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        In order to test the web site properly, the team tested the web site on several devices. These devices were
        either a Windows computer or a Mac. The team members did not try to use a mobile device, however. But Chrome's
        developer's tools were used to simulate a typical mobile screen device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we used several web browsers to see how the web site handled a variety of browsers. The web site
        was tested on the following web browsers: Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results of the platform tests were, for the most part, good. The web site worked as expected on all of the
        web browsers. When we tried using smaller screens, the majority of the web page looked fine. The icons in
        the footer, however, did not adjust properly. Thus, if the screen becomes small -- e.g. with a mobile device --
        the footer does not work properly.

        <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zGW2ft_NN9wP4aXeFOkvbQ73_EFl4gDQkRztWbFQLB4/edit#gid=1625275660">
        results of the Google Form</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Testers from each category reported that the page was easy to navigate and not too complex.
        On the other hand, one of the respondents did say that he did not think it
        was likely that he would use the page again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The client also responded positively to the web site. She agreed with the rest of the testers that the web site
        was easy to navigate, displayed the products nicely, and provided the information that she deemed relevant.
        However, the client had some critical remarks, as well. Some of the images were not placed in the right category and
        she would have liked to use some different images as cover photos.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also did some live testing. One of the team members had two of his roommates try out the site. The testers
        were simply put in front of the web page, and was not told what to do. When asked about the navigation structure,
        they said that it was easy to find their way around the web site. One of the testers pointed out some
        grammatical errors that annoyed him.

        <h2>Our Response</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        The results of the Google Form showed that -- although, once again, bearing in mind the shortcomings having a
        small sample size -- on the whole, we have succeeded. The testers indicate that the web site was easy to navigate,
        regardless of their age or their self-reported technological competence. In other wrods, the form seems to indicate
        that we are on the right track.
        As to the respondent indicating that he was not likely to use the page again, it is difficult to know what he
        meant. One possibility could be that he simply did not like the design of the page. Another could be that the
        products Steintøykjelleren is selling is not something that interests him. In hindsight, we should probably have
        added a more specific question about the layout and other aspects of the web design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The team was very happy that the client liked the web site. As to her criticisms, there seems to have been a
        misunderstanding when we downloaded the product images. Some pictures have been named bestikk, for instance,
        even though they actually belong to the servise section. The team acknowledges that this was an error on their part.
        The team furthermore respect the client's wish to have other cover photos. Had this project gone on further, we would
        have rectified this, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
        The team was pleased that the live testers seemed to navigate around the page effortlessly. Had this project
        gone on further, we would have corrected the grammatical errors, as well.

        <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        Building the Steintøykjelleren website has been a real learning experience for our team.
        We've never done anything like this before and we all came away with a lot of ideas about
        specific things we could have done better as well as general thoughts about website building.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all we've realized that testing should start as early as possible.  We found
        that our testers were confused by things that we thought were straightforward.  Our testing
        helped us realize that our assumptions and prior knowledge made it difficult for us to
        see the website as a new user would.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we were to start over we would also try to spend more time early on coming up with a smart
        "framework" for our pages.  Time spent on details early on often turned out wasted when our plans
        changed.  Luckily we did spend a lot of time thinking about the general design and
        that turned out to be very benificial.  All in all we did learn a lot from the project, and
        we are really quite proud of the result.
